# ⚛️ React JS Learning Repository

Welcome to my **React JS Learning Journey**!  
This repository contains all my practice projects, experiments, and mini apps built while learning React — from basics to more structured concepts.

## 📚 About

This repo serves as a personal learning log as I explore **React JS**, understand its **core concepts**, and implement them through hands-on coding.

Each folder is a small step in the process — covering topics like components, props, state, hooks, and custom rendering logic.

- Functional Components  
- Props and Component Composition

- Conditional Rendering  
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
- Custom Rendering Logic (understanding how React might work internally)  
- Project setup using **Create React App** and **Vite**

---

### 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen understanding of **React fundamentals**  
- Practice building small interactive UI components  
- Prepare for larger real-world React projects
